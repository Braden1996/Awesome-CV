        \item Built and launched 10+ web and mobile apps (React, React Native, Redux, Node, AWS) using Agile methods (Lean, Scrum and DevOps), for billion dollar companies and Series A startups alike, including work on e-commerce platforms, data visualisations, machine learning algorithms and chatbots.

        \item Contributed several fixes and features to our internal project generator, most notable of which would spawn a React app hosted on \href{https://aws.amazon.com/s3/}{AWS S3} utilising \href{https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/}{CloudFront} and \href{https://aws.amazon.com/certificate-manager/}{Certificate Manager} for SSL (infrastructure as code via \href{https://www.terraform.io/}{Terraform}).
        \item Onboarded and trained, in both project tech-stack and methodology, \textasciitilde{}10 junior and \textasciitilde{}10 experienced developers.
        \item Delivered successful projects in as little as five weeks; acceleration has been made possible by an ability to build trust within the team - promoting the free and active challenge of the product backlog.
